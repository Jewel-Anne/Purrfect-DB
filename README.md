# Purrfect-DB
 "Purrfect Veterinary Clinic Database" is a database system developed as a requirement for the COSC 30013 Modeling and Simulation course. This system efficiently manages appointments, services, and associated costs at a veterinary clinic.

## Description
This database system will list, compile and handle the appointments or services that happened throughout a specific work day. This system will also secure the records of all the information needed in the service/s and will compute its cost appointed by the pet's owner. This way, the clinic can easily track down the appointments made in a day and the expected total income of the business.
